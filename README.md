# SALSA-and-HITS

This repository contains the Python code to perform network analysis on maternal care data using SALSA and HITS algorithms. The analysis aims to identify hub counties and authoritative counties in the context of maternal care based on the birth occurrence and mother's residence data. Both algorithms were tested, but were found to generate similar results.

## How to Use

1. Install the required packages from `requirements.txt`:
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Prepare your dataset to have at least two columns: `OC_County_FIPS` and `MR_County_FIPS`.

3. Run the provided Python script by passing your dataframe to the `process_data_and_run_algorithms` function.

## Data Privacy

The code is designed to work with a confidential dataset and as such does not include any real data.

## Results

The results found were quite unique and can be interpreted from many different presepctives.
